# Root Kustomization for Applications
# ====================================
#
# This Flux Kustomization watches the apps/ directory and
# reconciles all application resources (SpiceDB, observability, etc.).
#
# IMPORTANT: This Kustomization depends on infrastructure being ready.
# Applications require networking, storage, and other infrastructure
# components to be operational before deployment.
