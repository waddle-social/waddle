# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/scripts/` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Code Quality**: Identify the lint, formatting, and type-check commands that will gate delivery and describe reuse of `shared/packages/` modules instead of new packages.
- **Testing**: Detail the fail-first test strategy (unit, integration, contract) and how it will run locally and in CI.
- **User Experience**: Confirm the feature uses components from `shared/packages/ui-web`, documents accessibility verification (WCAG 2.1 AA), and lists copy/localization updates.
- **Performance**: Define p95 server response <= 150 ms and p75 LCP <= 2.5 s budgets plus the instrumentation that will verify them.
- **Federated CQRS**: Map read flows to GraphQL federation subgraphs, show write orchestration through Cloudflare Workflows or `capnweb`, and outline the contract tests that protect the boundary.
- **Exceptions**: Log any temporary deviations (including CQRS/federation gaps), the owner, and the planned remediation before release.
- **Data Services** *(if applicable)*: Document the `generate.ts` entry point, generator options (database bindings, write-model toggle, extra deps), schema snapshot path (e.g., `read-model/schema.gql`), Bun scripts added (`bun run test:<service>`), and which quickstart/docs will be updated.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
